                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <br>
            <p>This satirical website critiques the challenges and issues in modern work environments. The push for control and productivity can have significant impacts on employees' mental and physical health, especially when they are subjected to intensive work in harsh, unregulated conditions. Examining this topic in a satirical light serves as a method to address surplus labor and capitalist management. This critique is crucial for raising awareness about these issues, fostering dialogue, and advocating for necessary changes in how workplaces are structured and managed.</p>
            <p>The imaginative website is for capitalist managers who desire greater control over their workers. It offers solutions and techniques designed to push employee performance to its limits and increase managerial control over the labor force. It neglects workers' needs, such as higher living wages and basic employee benefits, to further a more capitalist approach for company success. Instead, it presents itself as a cutting-edge labor management solution for the future. The website presents itself as a trailblazing labor management solution for the future, one that is more in tune with the capitalist ideal than with the welfare of the workers. </p>

                <h3>Topic Research</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The research underpinning the parody website draws from a Marxist perspective on managerial authority and the hierarchical division of labor. According to "Contradictions of the Labour Process, Worker Empowerment and Capitalist Inefficiency", Marx's three-stage development theory (cooperation, manufacture, and large-scale industry) criticizes the substantial control capitalists exert over their workforce.</p>
                <p>In this theory, Marx highlights the intentional segregation of skilled and unskilled workers, leading to a division of labor and significant wage disparity between low and high earners. This greatly impacts the lives of unskilled workers, compelling them to work extended hours to fulfill their basic needs. Additionally, a hierarchical division of labor disregards “the needs of workers as humans in terms of skill development and opportunities for intellectual engagement in their work” (Vidal, 2019). </p>
                <p>To achieve this control, capitalist management must gather "workers together into a single location under the authority of a single capitalist" and manage a "large-scale industry, distinguished by the use of machinery."</p>
